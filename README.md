# LockBox
Solana smart contract to lock funds and release a % in certain time

 
This will deploy the TimeLocked contract to the Solana blockchain, and set the release time to 1 hour from now, with an unlock interval of 1 day and a release percentage of 50%.

You can then call the release() function on the contract to release the locked funds according to the specified time and percentage.
